# PSYC193_IntroPython_W2019
Instructor: John Serences 
Instructor's Office: 5338 McGill Hall 

## Time/Location: Weds 9-11:50am, Mandler 1539 (on the Muir Campus, classroom to the right if you're facing the UG advising office). 

## First class Jan 9th, 2019

## Course description
This course will introduce new programmers to Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Experience in another language may help, but no programming experience is neccessary as we'll start with the basics. 

Along the way we'll learn how to implement some simple statistical tests and general analysis techniques that many of you will encounter in your course work and in research projects.  

## Goal of the course
At the end of the course you should have a good understanding of the Python language and the Jupyter environment. You should also have some knowledge about the relative strengths and weaknesses of Python and other common languages like Matlab. 

## Class time
Each week class time will be divided into several short lectures followed by coding sessions where you will work either alone or in small groups on exercises designed to reinforce topics from the lecture. I will walk around to provide help on the in-class assignments. After each work period is complete, I will display work from one person (or group) and will ask that person (or group) to walk us through their code. 

## Textbook
Title: Python crash course : a hands-on, project-based introduction to programming
Author: Matthes, Eric

One copy of this book is on reserve at the library, and you can purchase from Amazon (both new and used) [here](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Hands-Project-Based/dp/1593276036/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1546894838&sr=1-1&keywords=Python+Crash+Course%3A+A+Hands-On%2C+Project-Based+Introduction+to+Programming)

The book is not absolutely essential, but the first 1/2 of the course (at least) will track the topics in the book closely. This is intentional so that you can get the material in class and then also read the book to provide another perspective. 

## Exams

### Short Quizes
At the start of classes [01,02,03,06,07,08,09] there will be a short quiz with questions focused on topics from the previous classes. These quizzes will be given online using google forms and must be taken in class. 

Each of the 8 quizzes will be worth 10 points

### Midterm
In class 05 on February 13th there will be a longer midterm that will cover material from the first 4 classes. This midterm will be worth 50 points. 

### Final Exam
During finals week, during our assigned 3 hour time slot, there will be a comprehensive exam that covers material from the entire course. This final will be worth 100 points.

## Letter grade in course
Grades will be based on the percentage of points earned on quizzes, the midterm and the final. 

Letter grades will be assigned based on the following table:

 A+ 	  97 	 100
 
 A 	    93 	 96.99999
 
 A- 	  90 	 92.99999
 
 B+ 	  87 	 89.99999
 
 B 	    83 	 86.99999
 
 B- 	  80 	 82.99999
 
 C+ 	  77 	 79.99999
 
 C 	    73 	 76.99999
 
 C- 	  70 	 72.99999
 
 D+ 	  67 	 69.99999
 
 D 	    63 	 66.99999
 
 D- 	  60 	 62.99999
 
 F 	    0 	 59.99999
 

Example: There are 80+50+100=230 total points in the course and you earn a total of 203 points. You would end up with a 88.2% and would earn a B+ in the course.
