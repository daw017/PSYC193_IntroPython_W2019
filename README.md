## Course description
This course will introduce new programmers to Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Experience in another language will likely help, but no experience neccessary as we will start with the basics. 

Along the way we'll learn how to implement some simple statistical tests and general analysis techniques.  

## Goal of the course
At the end of the course you should have a good understanding of Python language and the Jupyter environment. You should also have some knowledge regarding the strengths and weaknesses of Python and other common languages like Matlab. 

## Class time
Each week class time will be divided into several short lectures followed by coding sessions where you will usually work together in small groups on exercises designed around the lectures.
