# PSYC193_IntroPython_W2019

# Instructor: John Serences 

# Instructor's Office: 5338 McGill Hall 

## Meeting time: Weds 9-11:50am

## Location: Mandler 1539 (on the Muir Campus, classroom is just to the right if you're facing the UG advising office). 

## First class Jan 9th, 2019

## Course description
This course will introduce new programmers to Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Experience in another language may help, but no programming experience is necessary as we'll start with the basics. 

Along the way you'll learn how to implement some simple statistical tests and general analysis techniques that many of you will encounter in your course work and in research projects.  

## Goal of the course
At the end of the course you should have a good understanding of the Python language and the Jupyter environment. You should also have some knowledge about the relative strengths and weaknesses of Python and other common languages like Matlab. 

## Class time
Each week class time will be divided into several short lectures followed by coding sessions where you will work either alone or in small groups on exercises designed to reinforce topics from the lecture. I will walk around to provide help on the in-class assignments. After each work period is complete, I will display work from one person (or group) and will ask that person (or group) to walk us through their code. 

## Textbook
Title: Python crash course : a hands-on, project-based introduction to programming
Author: Matthes, Eric

One copy of this book is on reserve at the library, and you can purchase from Amazon (both new and used) [here](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Hands-Project-Based/dp/1593276036/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1546894838&sr=1-1&keywords=Python+Crash+Course%3A+A+Hands-On%2C+Project-Based+Introduction+to+Programming)

The book is not absolutely essential, but the first 6-7 lectures will closely track the chapters in Part I of the book so that you can get the material in class and then also read the book to provide another perspective. 

## Exams

### Short Quizzes
At the start of most class times [classes: 01,02,03,06,07,08,09] there will be a short quiz with questions focused on topics from the previous classes (approx. 10 multiple questions). These quizzes will be given online using google forms and must be taken in class. 

Each of the 8 quizzes will be worth 10 points.

You can drop 2 of the 8 quizzes, so your grade will be based on the highest 6 quiz scores. You can drop two quizzes to give you some flexibility if you need to be late for a class or if you have other obligations that prevent you from preparing.  

### Midterm
In class 05 on February 13th there will be a midterm that will cover material from the first 4 classes. The midterm will be worth 50 points. 

### Final Exam
During finals week, during our assigned 3 hour time slot, there will be a comprehensive exam that covers material from the entire course. The final will be worth 100 points.

## In-class problem sets
Most weeks in class we will have a problem set. You will usually work on this collaboratively in groups, although some assignments may be individual. 

Plenty of time will be given in class to work on these problem sets, so hopefully they will be mostly completed by the time you leave each day. These assignments are meant to give you the hands-on practice that you need to develop fluency in the language. 

At the end of the quarter, you must have all assignments done and your notebooks saved in your course folder on Google Drive (I will explain this in the first class). 

I will check all problem sets periodically throughout the quarter, and completion of each assignment will be worth 5 points, for a total of 35-40 points (for 7-8 in-class problem sets) 

## Letter grade in course
Grades will be based on the percentage of points earned on quizzes, the midterm and the final. 

Letter grades will be assigned based on the following table:

A+ 97-100

A 93-96.99999

A- 90-92.99999
 
B+ 87-89.99999
 
B 83-86.99999
 
B- 80-82.99999
 
C+ 77-79.99999
 
C 73-76.99999
 
C- 70-72.99999
 
D+ 67-69.99999
 
D 63-66.99999
 
D- 60-62.99999
 
F 0-59.99999

Example: There are 60 (best 6/8 quizzes) + 50 (midterm) + 100 (final) + 40 (inclass problem sets) = 250 total points in the course and you earn a total of 213 points. You would end up with a (193/210) = 85.2% and would earn a B in the course. 

Grades will not be rounded.

## Academic Integrity

[From UCSD Academic Integrity office](https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/take-action/promote-integrity/faculty/syllabus-statements.html#General-statement-on-academic-i)

"Integrity of scholarship is essential for an academic community. The University expects that both faculty and students will honor this principle and in so doing protect the validity of University intellectual work. For students, this means that all academic work will be done by the individual to whom it is assigned, without unauthorized aid of any kind."

[Please read the full UCSD policy](http://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Appendices/2)

This course will also make use of online quizzes and exams via Google Forms. This means that each of you will be sent an email and will take quizzes/exams online with your user_name@ucsd.edu email linked to your grade. Taking a quiz or exam logged in as another student will be treated as a violation and you will be referred for disciplinary action. Similarly, emailing with or otherwise communicating with other students or anyone else during a quiz or exam will be treated as a violation and also referred for disciplinary action.
